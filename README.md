Evaluate the performance of each model
Finally, use the testing data to evaluate each model and compare the performance.
Use the above to answer the following:

Which model has a lower loss? The LSTM Stock Predictor model using Closing Prices has a lower loss of 0.0204
Which model tracks the actual values better over time? The LSTM Stock Predictor model using Closing Prices tracks better between the two.
Which window size works best for the model? After a couple of trial and error, for me the 14 day window worked the best.
